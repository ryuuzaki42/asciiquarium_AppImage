perl-Term-Animation (ASCII sprite animation framework)

This module provides a framework to produce sprite animations using ASCII art.

Each ASCII 'sprite' is given one or more frames, and placed into the animation as an 'animation object'.

An animation object can have a callback routine that controls the position and frame of the object.
